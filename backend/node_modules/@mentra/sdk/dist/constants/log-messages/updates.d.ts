/**
 * updates.ts
 *
 * This file defines constant messages that should be displayed
 * in the terminal to notify developers about new SDK releases.
 *
 * Each function generates a stylized ASCII message (banner-style)
 * that highlights the latest SDK version and provides the npm install command.
 * https://patorjk.com/software/taag/
 *
 * These messages are intended to be logged to the console or shown in
 * terminal output so developers are aware of updates in a clear
 * and visually distinct way.
